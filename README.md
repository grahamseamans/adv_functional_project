# Perceptrons in Haskell

Graham Seamans

# Notes
- The data for MNIST comes from https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/, but bewarned, it runs very slowly and doesn't learn when using an external dataset.
- The toy example at the bottom of main does work, although not as well as I feel it should (it scores 75% on learning OR). 

# Future plans
- Make the either error handling in main neater.
